# Unit Converter v1.0 – Python CLI

A modular and menu-driven command-line Unit Converter application written in Python.  
It supports conversion across multiple measurement categories such as Length, Area, Volume, Weight, Temperature, and Time — making it a useful tool for students, daily utility, and practice in Python modular design.
